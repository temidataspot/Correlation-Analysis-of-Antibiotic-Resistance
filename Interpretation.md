# Analysis Interpretation

# 1. All Positive Correlations:
No negative correlations (no inverse relationships) between the antibiotics in terms of how the
bacteria respond to them. Essentially, if an isolate is resistant (or sensitive) to
one antibiotic, it tends to be resistant (or sensitive) to others as well.

○ This could indicate that resistance mechanisms in the Aeromonas species for
these antibiotics are related, suggesting cross-resistance or a general resistance
trend across the antibiotics tested.

# 2. Circle Size and Color Intensity:
○ Larger and darker red circles: These represent stronger positive correlations.
For example, if two antibiotics have a correlation closer to +1, it means that
bacterial isolates showing resistance (or sensitivity) to one antibiotic almost
always show the same response to the other. This could be due to similar
mechanisms of action or resistance pathways.

○ Smaller and lighter red circles: These indicate weaker positive correlations. A
weaker correlation means that while there is still a positive relationship, it’s not as
strong. Isolates might be resistant to one antibiotic but are not consistently
resistant to the other.

# Practical Implications:
● Cross-Resistance: The positive correlations suggest that when bacteria are resistant to
one antibiotic, they are likely to be resistant to others. This could complicate treatment
options because resistance to one drug might predict resistance to several others.

● Antibiotic Selection: Since we don’t have any negative correlations (which would
suggest some antibiotics are effective when others fail), it may be harder to find
antibiotics that are effective against resistant strains in this dataset.

# What to look for:
● Highly correlated antibiotics (larger red circles): If two antibiotics are highly
correlated, using them together might not be ideal since resistance to one likely predicts
resistance to the other.
● Moderate correlations (smaller red circles): These indicate antibiotics that don’t have
as strong a relationship and might offer more flexibility when designing treatment
strategies.
