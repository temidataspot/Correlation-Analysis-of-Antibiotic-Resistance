# Overview
In this project, I conducted a thorough correlation analysis to explore antibiotic resistance patterns 
across ten antibiotics: AMP, P, C, CIP, OT, N, CT, SXT, CN, and AML. Using R, I aimed to understand potential co-resistance relationships 
between these antibiotics, allowing for insights into whether resistance to one antibiotic might be associated with resistance to another.

The analysis involved calculating correlation coefficients for each pair of antibiotics to evaluate the strength and direction of resistance correlations. 
This approach helped me identify antibiotics that may share resistance mechanisms or be influenced by similar environmental or clinical factors, leading to 
patterns of multidrug resistance. These findings could guide clinicians in making informed treatment choices, particularly in settings where resistance is 
prevalent, and inform broader antimicrobial stewardship efforts.

By visualizing these correlations in R, I generated a clear representation of the antibiotic resistance landscape, making it easier to identify clusters or networks of correlated resistance. This project contributes valuable data for understanding how resistance traits propagate and interact, supporting more strategic approaches to managing antimicrobial resistance.
